<p style ="font-family: 'Courier New'; color:Black; font-size: 25px;">
Being Mexican and growing up with a strong understanding and appreciation for my own culture, I have always been aware of the beauty of Mexican culture, but also the issues that are prominent within it. As a Mexican woman, misogyny is no stranger to me.
<br>
<br>
I have always been aware of the fact that Mexican men will always be seen as superior simply because of something that cannot be controlled: the sex you are born as.
Misogyny in Mexico has created immense and horrifying issues such as the femicides of Mexican women.
<br>
<br>
Everyday, approximately eleven Mexican women are killed. To me, this issue is one that tears my heart. For this reason, I created my piece with the intention to pay homage and mourn these women, while bringing awareness to femicides in Mexico. Having to live in fear of being murdered is not truly living. The machismo, mysogynistic culture of Mexico, as well as other Latin American countries, require an urgent discussion, as we CANNOT lose any more women. Some as young as seven, others in their mid thirties - it is time for Mexicans to come together and fight for women that have been lost and fight for women's right to live.
